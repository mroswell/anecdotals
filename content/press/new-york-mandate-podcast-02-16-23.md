Jennifer talks in depth about why she chooses compassion over anger in her attempt to change the narrative, “There are people right now that are going to commit suicide in three weeks if they don't feel heard. . . . So there's something actively that needs to be done. . . . I think the way to help is to come together and figure out how to make a change. So that's why I have my perspective, because that's what I see every day, is the people that are hurt. And that's what I care about.”
