description : "Dearly Discarded is a podcast dedicated to people who have been silenced. Participants are from all walks of life, but they have one thing in common: they participated in the “safe and effective” medicine that they believed would protect them during the pandemic. Now they are injured and ignored. Please listen with an open mind and heart. Hear these voices and share their stories with your friends and family."
